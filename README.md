# JosephTV - Digital art is true.

## Project Overview
Joseph - “an app for providing art on smart TV”
The task was to give users an interactive selection of digital works of art in the form of videos
which can then be combined to a movie on SMART TV.

## Why this Project?
I developed Joseph because I was looking for alternative ways to present my art.
During my work I was confronted more and more with the idea of digital space.
What exactly is digital space and how does it show itself?
The way to reinterpret an exhibition space captivates me and has motivated me so much to implement and complete joseph according to my ideas.
In the end, Joseph itself became a work of art and the metaphor: “The expression wanders through space” is the message that emanates from the heart of the matter.

## JosephTV
Figure one shows Google Authentication followed by a Firebase database query. After logging in, the data is confirmed and made available to the user in a grid view.
If the user clicks one of the selected tiles in Figure two, he gets to another control element Figure three, which should create space for more specific information. At the bottom of this element there is a possible selection from the already existing playlists. Figure four shows the video player with its operating dynamics and the task flow, which commands you back to the detailed selection if a video is selected.
