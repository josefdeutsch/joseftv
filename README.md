# JosephTV - Digital art is true.

## Project Overview
Joseph - “an app for providing art on smart TV”
The task was to give users an interactive selection of digital works of art in the form of videos
which can then be combined to a movie on SMART TV.

## Why this Project?
I developed Joseph because I was looking for alternative ways to present my art.
During my work I was confronted more and more with the idea of digital space.
What exactly is digital space and how does it show itself?
The way to reinterpret an exhibition space captivates me and has motivated me so much to implement and complete joseph according to my ideas.
In the end, Joseph itself became a work of art and the metaphor: “The expression wanders through space” is the message that emanates from the heart of the matter.
